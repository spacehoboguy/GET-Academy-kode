        <div class="paragraph"> a Atlas Shrugged is a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand. It was her longest novel, the fourth and
            final one published
            during her lifetime, and the one she considered her magnum opus in the realm of fiction writing.[1] Atlas
            Shrugged includes elements of science fiction, mystery, and romance, and it contains Rand's most extensive
            statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction. Rand described the theme of Atlas Shrugged as "the
            role
            of man's mind in existence". </div>

        <div class="paragraph">b The book explores a number of philosophical themes from which Rand would subsequently
            develop Objectivism,
            including reason, property rights, individualism, and capitalism, and depicts what Rand saw as the failures
            of
            governmental coercion.

            The book depicts a dystopian United States in which private businesses suffer under increasingly burdensome
            laws
            and regulations. Railroad executive Dagny Taggart and her lover, steel magnate Hank Rearden, struggle
            against
            "looters" who want to exploit their productivity.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">c They discover that a mysterious figure called John Galt
            is persuading other business leaders to abandon their companies and disappear as a strike of productive
            individuals
            against the looters. The novel ends with the strikers planning to build a new capitalist society based on
            Galt's
            philisophy.</div>

        <div class="paragraph">d
            Atlas Shrugged received largely negative reviews, but achieved enduring popularity and ongoing sales in the
            following decades. The novel has been cited as an influence on a variety of libertarian and conservative
            thinkers
            and politicians. After several unsuccessful attempts to adapt the novel for film or television, a film
            trilogy
            based
            on it was released from 2011 to 2014, and two theatrical adaptations have been staged.</div>
